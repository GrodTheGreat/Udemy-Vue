# The complete VUE JS course

## Build beautiful web apps using VUE JS, version 3. Pinia and Firebase included

Do you want to learn the **whole process of building your App with Vue?.** This is the course for you.

We will start from the very **beginning**, from "_I don't even know how use it, and why should I_â€œ to actually **understanding how Vue works and make it communicate with other technologies like Firebase.**

You will learn all the **logic** and **practice** behind **Vue** in different modules, and as we advance through the course we will be increasing the difficulty.

Since I believe that the best way to fully **learn is by coding**, after each important section we will put everything in **practice** with some **course projects**, and after you have a **strong base of Vue** we will journey into **Routes, PINIA and Authentication**.

To sum everything up, you will learn in this course:

- The very **basics of Vue JS.** How to install and the logic behind it.
- We will build a tiny web game just knowing the basics.
- Once we are done with the basics, we will use **Vue** like the pro's by using the VITE.
- We will connect our **Vue** app with technologies like **Firebase**.
- Everybody is using **PINIA**, so we will learn how to use it.
- Once we know the hardcore stuff about **Vue**, **PINIA** and **routes** we will put everything in practice by creating a practice project where we will mix it all.
- You also get a **Full ES6 course,** just in case

**What about the instructor experience ?**

Well I've been around for **15 years now**, built lots of applications for small and big companies like **Citi, Fox, Disney and a lot more.**

Today I work as developer for a major company developing applications with **Vue**, **React or Angular**, but I like to teach in my spare time.

**How about the target audience?**

- This course is for almost everyone, a little bit of JavaScript is required. We will use ES6 but you can learn as we go.
